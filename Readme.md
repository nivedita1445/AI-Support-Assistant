# AI-Powered Customer Support Assistant (Backend)

---

## Overview
This project is a **production-ready backend service** that integrates AI into
customer support workflows while ensuring **data privacy, reliability, and
cloud readiness**.

The system is designed as a reusable backend API that can be consumed by
multiple clients (web, mobile, chat systems) without UI dependency.

---

## Problem Statement
Customer support teams handle large volumes of repetitive queries.
Directly integrating AI into such systems introduces challenges related to:
- Data privacy (GDPR)
- API reliability and quota limits
- Inconsistent AI responses
- Secure configuration management

This project addresses these challenges at the backend level.

---

## Architecture Summary
1. Client sends a support query via REST API
2. Backend masks sensitive data (email, phone, etc.)
3. Masked query is converted into a structured AI prompt
4. AI service is invoked safely
5. If AI is unavailable, a fallback response is returned
6. A stable API response is sent back to the client

---

## Key Features
- REST API with frozen contract
- AI integration with explicit fallback handling
- GDPR-compliant sensitive data masking
- Privacy-safe structured logging
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Environment-variable based secret management
- Predictable response confidence and source metadata

---

## Tech Stack
- Java 17
- Spring Boot
- REST APIs
- Spring Boot Actuator
- SLF4J Logging

---

## API Endpoints

### Submit Support Query
**POST** `/api/v1/support/query`

**Request**
```
{
  "query": "My payment failed but money was deducted"
}
```

**Response**
```
{
"response": "Thank you for reaching out. We understand your concern...",
"confidence": "MEDIUM",
"source": "AI"
}
```

- source = AI → response generated by AI
- source = SYSTEM → fallback response
- Confidence reflects response certainty
---
## Data Privacy & GDPR

- Sensitive fields are masked before processing
- Only masked data is sent to AI services
- Logs never contain raw customer input 
- API keys are externalized via environment variables

---
## Health Check

**GET** ```/actuator/health```
```
{
"status": "UP"
}
```

- Used for monitoring, AWS health checks, and load balancers.
---
## Configuration

**Secrets are loaded securely using environment variables:**
```
ai.api.key=${AI_API_KEY:DUMMY_KEY_FOR_LOCAL}
```

- This enables the same build to run locally and in cloud environments.
---
## Local Run
```mvn spring-boot:run```


**Application runs on:**

```http://localhost:8085```
---

## Project Status
✔ Completed  
✔ Production-ready backend service  
✔ Designed for resume, interviews, and real-world use cases

---

## Why This Project Matters
This project focuses on **how AI should be used in real backend systems**, not
just calling an AI API.

It demonstrates:
- Responsible AI integration
- GDPR-aware data handling (EU-focused)
- Failure-safe backend design
- Production readiness without UI dependency

The service can be easily integrated with any frontend or chat platform.
