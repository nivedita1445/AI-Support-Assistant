# AI-Powered Customer Support Assistant (Backend)

---

## Overview
This project is a **production-grade backend service** that integrates AI into
customer support workflows while ensuring **data privacy, reliability,
observability, and cloud deployment readiness**.

The system is designed as a **backend-only REST API** (no UI by design) so it can
be consumed by web, mobile, chatbot, or enterprise systems.

✅ Dockerized  
✅ Deployed on **AWS EC2 (EU region)**  
✅ Production-ready backend architecture

---

## Problem Statement
Customer support teams handle large volumes of repetitive and sensitive queries.
Naively integrating AI introduces several risks:

- GDPR and data privacy violations  
- AI quota failures and unstable responses  
- No request traceability or observability  
- Hardcoded secrets and insecure configs  
- No fallback when AI services fail  

This project solves these problems by building a **safe, observable, fallback-enabled AI backend**.

## Live API: 
- Test on Postman

*POST*
```
http://35.156.156.13:8085/api/v1/support/query
```

*GET*
```
http://35.156.156.13:8085/actuator/health
```

---

## High-Level Architecture
1. Client sends a support query via REST API  
2. Backend **masks sensitive data** (email, phone, etc.)  
3. Request is assigned a **correlation/request ID**  
4. Masked query is converted into a structured AI prompt  
5. AI service is invoked safely  
6. **Fallback response is returned if AI is unavailable**  
7. Response includes **confidence level & source metadata**  
8. Logs remain privacy-safe and traceable  

---

## Key Features
- REST API with **frozen contract**
- AI integration with **explicit fallback handling**
- GDPR-compliant **PII masking**
- **Request tracing (correlation IDs)** for debugging
- **Rate limiting** to prevent abuse
- Privacy-safe structured logging
- Health check endpoint for monitoring
- Environment-variable based secret management
- Predictable response confidence and source metadata
- Dockerized for cloud deployment

---

## Tech Stack
- Java 17  
- Spring Boot  
- REST APIs  
- Spring Boot Actuator  
- SLF4J Logging  
- Docker  
- AWS EC2 (Amazon Linux – EU region)

---

## API Endpoints

### Submit Support Query
**POST** `/api/v1/support/query`

**Request**
```
{
  "query": "My payment failed but money was deducted"
}
```

**Response**
```
{
"response": "Thank you for reaching out. We understand your concern...",
"confidence": "MEDIUM",
"source": "AI"
}
```

- source = AI → response generated by AI
- source = SYSTEM → fallback response
- Confidence reflects response certainty
  
---
## Data Privacy & GDPR
This project is designed with **EU GDPR principles** in mind and ensures that
customer data is handled responsibly at the backend level.

- Sensitive fields such as **email IDs and phone numbers are masked**
- Only **masked data** is sent to AI services
- Raw customer input is **never logged**
- Logs contain only correlation IDs and safe metadata
- API keys and secrets are **never hardcoded**
- Configuration is externalized using environment variables

This makes the system suitable for **EU-based production environments**.

---

## Observability & Reliability
- Each request is tagged with a **unique request ID**
- Logs are traceable across controller, service, and AI layers
- AI failures (quota, network, timeout) are handled gracefully
- A **fallback system response** is returned when AI is unavailable
- Health check endpoint enables monitoring and cloud readiness

---

## Health Check

**GET** ```/actuator/health```
```
{
"status": "UP"
}
```

- Used for monitoring, AWS health checks, and load balancers.
---

## Configuration & Secrets
Secrets and environment-specific configurations are handled securely using
**environment variables**, ensuring no sensitive data is committed to the
repository.

```properties
ai.api.key=${AI_API_KEY:DUMMY_KEY_FOR_LOCAL}
```

- This enables the same build to run locally and in cloud environments.
  
---
## Local Run
```mvn spring-boot:run```


**Application runs on:**

```http://localhost:8085```
---

## Deployment
This project is **fully containerized and deployed on AWS**, demonstrating a
real-world backend deployment flow.

### Deployment Stack
- **Docker** for containerization
- **AWS EC2 (EU region)** for hosting
- Amazon Linux with Docker runtime
- Public API access via EC2 public IP

### Live API: 
- Test on Postman
  
```http
POST http://35.156.156.13:8085/api/v1/support/query
```

```http
GET http://35.156.156.13:8085/actuator/health
```

**Note:**
- This project intentionally does not include a UI.
- It is designed as a reusable backend service that can be integrated with any frontend, chatbot, or enterprise system.
  
---

## Why This Project Matters
This project focuses on **how AI should be used in real backend systems**, not
just calling an AI API.

It demonstrates:
- Real-world AI integration at the backend layer
- GDPR-aware data handling (EU-focused)
- Failure-safe AI design with fallback responses
- Request tracing and observability
- Secure configuration management
- Cloud deployment using Docker & AWS

The service can be easily integrated with any frontend or chat platform.
